## What is Insertion Sort?

Another sorting algorithm that again has different trade-offs is **insertion sort**. Rather than multiple iterations over the list, **insertion sort** splits the array into two parts: a sorted portion and an unsorted portion. It builds the sorted portion one element at a time by looking at each element in the unsorted portion and inserting it into the sorted portion of the array.

While this can be relatively efficient for small arrays, the trade-off for larger arrays is that many elements must be shifted around to create the sorted portion of the array.

The pseudocode for **insertion sort** would look like this:

```
for i from 1 to n-1
    call 0'th through i-1'th elements the "sorted side"
    remove i'th element
    insert it into sorted side in order
```


## Computational Complexity

Though **insertion sort** does not require iterating through the array multiple times, as did our other sorting algorithms, it does require significant shifting of elements in the sorted portion of the array, especially with the elements are in reverse order. So the time complexity of **insertion sort** is still **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**, however the best case scenario is on the order of *n* when the elements are already sorted.

## Your Turn

Complete the `insertions_sort()` function on the right to sort the supplied array.

Notice that the insertion sort function has a return type of `void`. This means the function doesn't return anything. What it does do is sort the array.

The `print_array()` function is given to you to print out the array after you've sorted it, to make sure your algorithm works properly.

{% spoiler "Hint" %}

1. You might want to start this by simply using an outer `for` loop that begins at `i = 1` and iterates through to the end of the array.
2. Since we assume that elements up to `arr[i - 1]` are sorted, and `arr[i]` is the next unsorted element of the array, you might temporarily store the value of `arr[i]` in a new variable for use later on (`element = arr[i]`). Since we'll be moving through the sorted portion of the array to see where the variable `element` will fit in, save the current index, `i` in a new variable `j`.
3. Now you'll need to look through the sorted portion of the array, moving from right to left, to find a value that is less than or equal to `element`. As long as the condition `j > 0 && arr[j - 1] > element` is true, (consider using this condition with a `while` loop) shift each value in the sorted array to the right, by setting it's value to the value of the element one space to the left, `arr[j] = arr[j - 1]`. Now decrease `j` by one to look at the next element in the next iteration of your `while` loop.
4. Finally when this condition is no longer true, you've found the correct spot in the sorted portion of the array for `element`. You can now set its value into the proper spot in the sorted array, `arr[j] = element`.

Nothing much you can do to optimize here, as we were able to do with bubble sort.
