# Models and Simulations

In this lab you will learn:

- Why we use computer models and simulation
- What are some commonly used applications

## What is Computer Modeling and Simulation?

**Models and simulations** are representations of complex objects and/or events. They can be used to predict or explain actual occurrences in the real world. **Models** are the computer algorithms that capture behavior of the object or system being looked at, and **simulation** is the running of the program that contains these algorithms.

Models and simulations are used for many reasons. It may be safer and more cost effective to create a computer model to test out a new product design, than building the actual product for testing. A simulation could allow us to change variables of a model and observe the effects, which may not be feasible in real life.

## Commonly Used Applications of Modeling

Common applications include flight simulators to train pilots, weather forecasting, and forecasting of risk. Models and simulations are used frequently in movies and video games to create computer generated imagery, creating special effects, animation and entire imaginary worlds!

A limitation of computer simulation is that they are abstraction of reality and may depend on oversimplified or generalized assumptions in their models.

## Your Turn

### Challenge 1

Complete the program on the right that is intended to simulate 80% of some number of students, *n*, getting at least a 4 on their APCSP exam. The program is missing a condition inside of the `for` loop, that will add one to the variable `sum` approximately 80% of the time. You should use the function `rand()` which generates a random number between 0 and 2147483647. This function has already been seeded with `srand(time(NULL))` so that it creates a different sequence of "random" numbers every time the program is executed.

{% spoiler "Hint" %}

Turns out that C includes an operator—alongside the usual suspects of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—called the modulo operator. Modulo (%) gives you the remainder after dividing its operands. But it can be useful for more than arithmetic remainders alone! Consider this line of code:

```c
int number = rand() % 5;
```

The effect of that line is to divide the return value of rand by 5 and store the remainder in `number`. What might the remainder be, though, when dividing some integer by 5? Well, there might be no remainder, in which case the answer is 0. Or there might be a remainder of 1, 2, 3 or 4. So this is a way of generating a pseudorandom number between 0 and 4, inclusive!

Now think of a condition that would be true roughly 80% of the time with a random number between 0 and 4. We know that `number == 0` should be true about 20% of the time. In the same way, `number < 2` is true when `number` is 0 or 1, which is 2 out of 5 times or 40% of the time. What condition can you come up with to simulate 80%?

### Challenge 2

The Monte Hall Problem is based on the TV game show, "Let's Make a Deal", and named after it's original host, Monte Hall. The idea is that the player is presented with 3 doors. One door has a car and the other two doors each have a goat. Hoping to win the car, the player chooses a door, say door 1. The host opens a different door, say door 3, that reveals a goat behind it. (The host will only open a door which has a goat and is not the door the player has chosen.) The player is then given the change to switch from door 1 to door 2. Should they make the switch?

The second challenge is to complete a simulation of this problem. The program is set up so that the three doors are represented by an integer array, `door`. We then have a `for` loop so that the simulation will run 3 million times. The game starts and door 1 (`door[0]`) is randomly assigned either 0, representing a goat, or 1, representing a car.

Your job is to:
1. Check if door 1 has a car, in which case you'll assign goats to doors 2 and 3.
2. If door 1 has a goat, randomly assign either a goat or car to door 2, and whatever is left to door 3.
3. Choose a random door, and save this in the variable `choice`
4. Since the host will only open a door with a goat, if door 2 or door 3 has a car, you will win if you switch.
5. Increment the variable `win_by_switch` for every win.

Once you've completed this, the program will print the number of wins you would have, out of 3 million games, if you always make the the switch!
